# Transfer Learning

## Concepts
### Multi-regression
- Prediction of multiple values given an image as input
- e.g. facial keypoint detection

### Multi-task learning
- Prediction of multiple items in a single shot
- e.g. age estimation and gender classification

### Self-training / self-supervised?

### Siamese networks

### Triplet loss
